# crash-scripts
A collection of scripts I used to reproduce crashes on broken systems or computers

## speedstep-freezer
Used to reproduce freezes on a particular system that were behaving differently based on SpeedStep settings.

## ssd-freezer
Used to reproduce freezes of a particular SSD that froze the whole system when it went to a combination of sleep and garbage collection.
